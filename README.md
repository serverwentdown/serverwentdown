### Hey there!

I am learning about building systems that scale, occasionally taking apart (physical and digital) things. I also build websites and run servers.

Talk to me about Kubernetes and Linux! I'm @serverwentdown [on](https://instagram.com/serverwentdown) [most](https://twitter.com/serverwentdown) [social](https://keybase.io/serverwentdown) [platforms](https://t.me/serverwentdown). 

> Why @serverwentdown? Because a good cluster can tolerate node failures.
